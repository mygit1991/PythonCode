3-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who
would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to
invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting
them to dinner.

guest = ['malick', 'irshad', 'rohan']

name = guest[0].title()
print(f"{name}, please come to dinner.")

name = guest[1].title()
print(f"{name}, please come to dinner.")

name = guest[2].title()
print(f"{name}, please come to dinner.")
